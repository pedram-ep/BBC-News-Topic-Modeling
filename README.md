# BBC-News-Topic-Modeling

This project focuses on topic modeling using a dataset of BBC news articles. The goal is to preprocess the text, apply dimensionality reduction techniques, perform clustering, and extract keywords to identify topics within the articles. The dataset includes articles from five categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech.
